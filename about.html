            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Phone Number Filter is a web application designed to process and refine phone numbers extracted from various sources, including Google Maps. This document outlines the step-by-step workflow of extracting, processing, and refining phone numbers using the application.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Extraction from Google Maps:</strong>
                    <p>Users start by copying data directly from Google Maps, which often includes phone numbers within formatted text. This data is then pasted into the "unformatted data" input area of the application.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Initial Processing of Numbers:</strong>
                    <p>After pasting the data, users press the "Process Numbers" button. The application extracts all recognizable phone numbers, filtering out unnecessary text and displaying them in the "Filtered Output" and "Combined Texted Output" sections.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Iterative Refinement:</strong>
                    <p>The "Combined Texted Output" can be copied and re-input into the "unformatted data" area for further refinement. Users can add more data and repeat the process to continually refine the phone numbers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Final Outputs and Usage:</strong>
                    <p>The final set of refined phone numbers is displayed, ready for texting or other forms of communication. The "untexted output" represents numbers that are prepared for new outreach efforts.</p>
